#Prog03: Create a program that ask user to input a number, continue asking until the user input is invalid. Display "Unique" after input when the inputted number don't have duplicate. Display "Duplicate" after input when the inputted number have duplicate.

#Create an empty list to store entered numbers
#Start an infinite loop that ask for user input
#Try to get user input as an integer

#If the number is already in the list
#Print "Duplicate"
#Else print "Unique"
#Add the number to the list

#If the input is not a valid integer (invalid input)
#Print an error message and terminate the program
