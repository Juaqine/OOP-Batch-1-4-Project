#Prog02: Create a program that ask user to input a number, continue asking until the user input is invalid. Display the number with the most number of duplicate.

#Create an empty list to store infinite numbers
#Start an infinite loop
#Get user input in integer
#Add it to the list (numbers)
#Create variable that checks the frequency of all the entered numbers
#If the user input is invalid, the program will terminate and will print the most duplicated number that appeared"
